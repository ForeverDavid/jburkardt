Quadrature Rules for a Square in 2D {#square_felippa_rule-quadrature-rules-for-a-square-in-2d align="center"}
===================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**SQUARE\_FELIPPA\_RULE** is a C++ library which generates the points
and weights of a Felippa quadrature rule over the interior of a square
in 2D.

Actually, the word "square" is meant to designate any quadrature region
defined by:

            A(1) <= X <= B(1)
            A(2) <= Y <= B(2)
