------------------------------------------------------------------------

**R8COL** is a C++ library which contains utility routines for "R8COL"
objects, that is, double precision real MxN arrays, considered as N
column vectors, each of length M. That is, the data may be thought of as
essentially multiple columns, and many operations will be carried out
columnwise.
