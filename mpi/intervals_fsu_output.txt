INTERVALS - Master process:
  C++ version

  An MPI example program,
  A quadrature over an interval is done by
  assigning subintervals to processes.

  The number of processes is 8

Process 0: Active!

Process 1: Active!

Process 2: Active!

Process 3: Active!

Process 4: Active!

Process 5: Active!

Process 6: Active!

Process 7: Active!

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Subintervals have been assigned.

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Estimate for PI is 3.14159
  Error is           1.70068e-07

  Elapsed wall clock seconds = 0.028964

INTERVALS - Master process:
  Normal end of execution.
