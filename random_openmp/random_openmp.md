RANDOM\_OPENMP\
Parallel Random Numbers with OpenMP {#random_openmp-parallel-random-numbers-with-openmp align="center"}
===================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RANDOM\_OPENMP** is a C++ program which uses random numbers during a
calculation that has been parallelized with OpenMP.

The random numbers are generated by a function which depends on a
user-defined integer called SEED. When multiple OpenMP threads are
involved, each thread should be assigned a different initial value for
SEED, in order that the threads generate distinct streams of random
numbers. This example shows one way that that can be done.
