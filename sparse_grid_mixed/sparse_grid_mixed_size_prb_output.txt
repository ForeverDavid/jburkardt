SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_SIZE_TEST
  SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_SIZE returns the number of distinct
  points in a multidimensional sparse grid with mixed factors.

  SPARSE_GRID_MIXED_SIZE_TOTAL returns the TOTAL number of
  points in a multidimensional sparse grid with mixed factors,
  without checking for duplication.

  Each sparse grid is of spatial dimension DIM_NUM,
  and is made up of product grids of levels up to LEVEL_MAX.
