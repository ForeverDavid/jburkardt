ALBANY\
Linear Algebra Library {#albany-linear-algebra-library align="center"}
======================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ALBANY** is a C++ program which allows the implementation of finite
element PDE solvers for a variety of fundamental research applications,
including LCM (Laboratory for Computational Mechanics), QCAD (Quantum
Computer Aided Design) and FELIX (Finite Element for Land Ice
eXperiments).

The highlight of Albany is the PDE assembly. The template-based generic
programming approach allows developers to just program for residual
equations, and all manner of derivatives and polynomial propogations get
automatically computed with no additional development effort.
