c this is the 24 feb 1997 version of
c lsoda.. livermore solver for ordinary differential equations, with
c         automatic method switching for stiff and nonstiff problems.
c
c this version is in double precision.
c
c lsoda solves the initial value problem for stiff or nonstiff
c systems of first order ode-s,
c     dy/dt = f(t,y) ,  or, in component form,
c     dy(i)/dt = f(i) = f(i,t,y(1),y(2),...,y(neq)) (i = 1,...,neq).
c
c this a variant version of the lsode package.
c it switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff methods.
c this means that the user does not have to determine whether the
c problem is stiff or not, and the solver will automatically choose the
c appropriate method.  it always starts with the nonstiff method.

c summary of usage.
c
c communication between the user and the lsoda package, for normal
c situations, is summarized here.  this summary describes only a subset
c of the full set of options available.  see the full description for
c details, including alternative treatment of the jacobian matrix,
c optional inputs and outputs, nonstandard options, and
c instructions for special situations.  see also the example
c problem (with program and output) following this summary.
c
c a. first provide a subroutine of the form..
c               subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot)
c               dimension y(neq), ydot(neq)
c which supplies the vector function f by loading ydot(i) with f(i).
c
c b. write a main program which calls subroutine lsoda once for
c each point at which answers are desired.  this should also provide
c for possible use of logical unit 6 for output of error messages
c by lsoda.  on the first call to lsoda, supply arguments as follows..
c f      = name of subroutine for right-hand side vector f.
c          this name must be declared external in calling program.
c neq    = number of first order ode-s.
c y      = array of initial values, of length neq.
c t      = the initial value of the independent variable.
c tout   = first point where output is desired (.ne. t).
c itol   = 1 or 2 according as atol (below) is a scalar or array.
c rtol   = relative tolerance parameter (scalar).
c atol   = absolute tolerance parameter (scalar or array).
c          the estimated local error in y(i) will be controlled so as
c          to be less than
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol     if itol = 1, or
c             ewt(i) = rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)  if itol = 2.
c          thus the local error test passes if, in each component,
c          either the absolute error is less than atol (or atol(i)),
c          or the relative error is less than rtol.
c          use rtol = 0.0 for pure absolute error control, and
c          use atol = 0.0 (or atol(i) = 0.0) for pure relative error
c          control.  caution.. actual (global) errors may exceed these
c          local tolerances, so choose them conservatively.
c itask  = 1 for normal computation of output values of y at t = tout.
c istate = integer flag (input and output).  set istate = 1.
c iopt   = 0 to indicate no optional inputs used.
c rwork  = real work array of length at least..
c             22 + neq * max(16, neq + 9).
c          see also paragraph e below.
c lrw    = declared length of rwork (in user-s dimension).
c iwork  = integer work array of length at least  20 + neq.
c liw    = declared length of iwork (in user-s dimension).
c jac    = name of subroutine for jacobian matrix.
c          use a dummy name.  see also paragraph e below.
c jt     = jacobian type indicator.  set jt = 2.
c          see also paragraph e below.
c note that the main program must declare arrays y, rwork, iwork,
c and possibly atol.
c
c c. the output from the first call (or any call) is..
c      y = array of computed values of y(t) vector.
c      t = corresponding value of independent variable (normally tout).
c istate = 2  if lsoda was successful, negative otherwise.
c          -1 means excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong jt).
c          -2 means excess accuracy requested (tolerances too small).
c          -3 means illegal input detected (see printed message).
c          -4 means repeated error test failures (check all inputs).
c          -5 means repeated convergence failures (perhaps bad jacobian
c             supplied or wrong choice of jt or tolerances).
c          -6 means error weight became zero during problem. (solution
c             component i vanished, and atol or atol(i) = 0.)
c          -7 means work space insufficient to finish (see messages).
c
c d. to continue the integration after a successful return, simply
c reset tout and call lsoda again.  no other parameters need be reset.
c
c e. note.. if and when lsoda regards the problem as stiff, and
c switches methods accordingly, it must make use of the neq by neq
c jacobian matrix, j = df/dy.  for the sake of simplicity, the
c inputs to lsoda recommended in paragraph b above cause lsoda to
c treat j as a full matrix, and to approximate it internally by
c difference quotients.  alternatively, j can be treated as a band
c matrix (with great potential reduction in the size of the rwork
c array).  also, in either the full or banded case, the user can supply
c j in closed form, with a routine whose name is passed as the jac
c argument.  these alternatives are described in the paragraphs on
c rwork, jac, and jt in the full description of the call sequence below.

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c example problem.
c
c the following is a simple example problem, with the coding
c needed for its solution by lsoda.  the problem is from chemical
c kinetics, and consists of the following three rate equations..
c     dy1/dt = -.04*y1 + 1.e4*y2*y3
c     dy2/dt = .04*y1 - 1.e4*y2*y3 - 3.e7*y2**2
c     dy3/dt = 3.e7*y2**2
c on the interval from t = 0.0 to t = 4.e10, with initial conditions
c y1 = 1.0, y2 = y3 = 0.  the problem is stiff.
c
c the following coding solves this problem with lsoda,
c printing results at t = .4, 4., ..., 4.e10.  it uses
c itol = 2 and atol much smaller for y2 than y1 or y3 because
c y2 has much smaller values.
c at the end of the run, statistical quantities of interest are
c printed (see optional outputs in the full description below).

c full description of user interface to lsoda.
c
c the user interface to lsoda consists of the following parts.
c
c i.   the call sequence to subroutine lsoda, which is a driver
c      routine for the solver.  this includes descriptions of both
c      the call sequence arguments and of user-supplied routines.
c      following these descriptions is a description of
c      optional inputs available through the call sequence, and then
c      a description of optional outputs (in the work arrays).
c
c ii.  descriptions of other routines in the lsoda package that may be
c      (optionally) called by the user.  these provide the ability to
c      alter error message handling, save and restore the internal
c      common, and obtain specified derivatives of the solution y(t).
c
c iii. descriptions of common blocks to be declared in overlay
c      or similar environments, or to be saved when doing an interrupt
c      of the problem and continued solution later.
c
c iv.  description of a subroutine in the lsoda package,
c      which the user may replace with his own version, if desired.
c      this relates to the measurement of errors.
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part i.  call sequence.
c
c the call sequence parameters used for input only are
c     f, neq, tout, itol, rtol, atol, itask, iopt, lrw, liw, jac, jt,
c and those used for both input and output are
c     y, t, istate.
c the work arrays rwork and iwork are also used for conditional and
c optional inputs and optional outputs.  (the term output here refers
c to the return from subroutine lsoda to the user-s calling program.)
c
c the legality of input parameters will be thoroughly checked on the
c initial call for the problem, but not checked thereafter unless a
c change in input parameters is flagged by istate = 3 on input.
c
c the descriptions of the call arguments are as follows.
c
c f      = the name of the user-supplied subroutine defining the
c          ode system.  the system must be put in the first-order
c          form dy/dt = f(t,y), where f is a vector-valued function
c          of the scalar t and the vector y.  subroutine f is to
c          compute the function f.  it is to have the form
c               subroutine f (neq, t, y, ydot)
c               dimension y(1), ydot(1)
c          where neq, t, and y are input, and the array ydot = f(t,y)
c          is output.  y and ydot are arrays of length neq.
c          (in the dimension statement above, 1 is a dummy
c          dimension.. it can be replaced by any value.)
c          subroutine f should not alter y(1),...,y(neq).
c          f must be declared external in the calling program.
c
c          subroutine f may access user-defined quantities in
c          neq(2),... and/or in y(neq(1)+1),... if neq is an array
c          (dimensioned in f) and/or y has length exceeding neq(1).
c          see the descriptions of neq and y below.
c
c          if quantities computed in the f routine are needed
c          externally to lsoda, an extra call to f should be made
c          for this purpose, for consistent and accurate results.
c          if only the derivative dy/dt is needed, use intdy instead.
c
c neq    = the size of the ode system (number of first order
c          ordinary differential equations).  used only for input.
c          neq may be decreased, but not increased, during the problem.
c          if neq is decreased (with istate = 3 on input), the
c          remaining components of y should be left undisturbed, if
c          these are to be accessed in f and/or jac.
c
c          normally, neq is a scalar, and it is generally referred to
c          as a scalar in this user interface description.  however,
c          neq may be an array, with neq(1) set to the system size.
c          (the lsoda package accesses only neq(1).)  in either case,
c          this parameter is passed as the neq argument in all calls
c          to f and jac.  hence, if it is an array, locations
c          neq(2),... may be used to store other integer data and pass
c          it to f and/or jac.  subroutines f and/or jac must include
c          neq in a dimension statement in that case.
c
c y      = a real array for the vector of dependent variables, of
c          length neq or more.  used for both input and output on the
c          first call (istate = 1), and only for output on other calls.
c          on the first call, y must contain the vector of initial
c          values.  on output, y contains the computed solution vector,
c          evaluated at t.  if desired, the y array may be used
c          for other purposes between calls to the solver.
c
c          this array is passed as the y argument in all calls to
c          f and jac.  hence its length may exceed neq, and locations
c          y(neq+1),... may be used to store other real data and
c          pass it to f and/or jac.  (the lsoda package accesses only
c          y(1),...,y(neq).)
c
c t      = the independent variable.  on input, t is used only on the
c          first call, as the initial point of the integration.
c          on output, after each call, t is the value at which a
c          computed solution y is evaluated (usually the same as tout).
c          on an error return, t is the farthest point reached.
c
c tout   = the next value of t at which a computed solution is desired.
c          used only for input.
c
c          when starting the problem (istate = 1), tout may be equal
c          to t for one call, then should .ne. t for the next call.
c          for the initial t, an input value of tout .ne. t is used
c          in order to determine the direction of the integration
c          (i.e. the algebraic sign of the step sizes) and the rough
c          scale of the problem.  integration in either direction
c          (forward or backward in t) is permitted.
c
c          if itask = 2 or 5 (one-step modes), tout is ignored after
c          the first call (i.e. the first call with tout .ne. t).
c          otherwise, tout is required on every call.
c
c          if itask = 1, 3, or 4, the values of tout need not be
c          monotone, but a value of tout which backs up is limited
c          to the current internal t interval, whose endpoints are
c          tcur - hu and tcur (see optional outputs, below, for
c          tcur and hu).
c
c itol   = an indicator for the type of error control.  see
c          description below under atol.  used only for input.
c
c rtol   = a relative error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  see description below under atol.
c          input only.
c
c atol   = an absolute error tolerance parameter, either a scalar or
c          an array of length neq.  input only.
c
c             the input parameters itol, rtol, and atol determine
c          the error control performed by the solver.  the solver will
c          control the vector e = (e(i)) of estimated local errors
c          in y, according to an inequality of the form
c                      max-norm of ( e(i)/ewt(i) )   .le.   1,
c          where ewt = (ewt(i)) is a vector of positive error weights.
c          the values of rtol and atol should all be non-negative.
c          the following table gives the types (scalar/array) of
c          rtol and atol, and the corresponding form of ewt(i).
c
c             itol    rtol       atol          ewt(i)
c              1     scalar     scalar     rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              2     scalar     array      rtol*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c              3     array      scalar     rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol
c              4     array      array      rtol(i)*abs(y(i)) + atol(i)
c
c          when either of these parameters is a scalar, it need not
c          be dimensioned in the user-s calling program.
c
c          if none of the above choices (with itol, rtol, and atol
c          fixed throughout the problem) is suitable, more general
c          error controls can be obtained by substituting a
c          user-supplied routine for the setting of ewt.
c          see part iv below.
c
c          if global errors are to be estimated by making a repeated
c          run on the same problem with smaller tolerances, then all
c          components of rtol and atol (i.e. of ewt) should be scaled
c          down uniformly.
c
c itask  = an index specifying the task to be performed.
c          input only.  itask has the following values and meanings.
c          1  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout (by overshooting and interpolating).
c          2  means take one step only and return.
c          3  means stop at the first internal mesh point at or
c             beyond t = tout and return.
c          4  means normal computation of output values of y(t) at
c             t = tout but without overshooting t = tcrit.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).  tcrit may be equal to
c             or beyond tout, but not behind it in the direction of
c             integration.  this option is useful if the problem
c             has a singularity at or beyond t = tcrit.
c          5  means take one step, without passing tcrit, and return.
c             tcrit must be input as rwork(1).
c
c          note..  if itask = 4 or 5 and the solver reaches tcrit
c          (within roundoff), it will return t = tcrit (exactly) to
c          indicate this (unless itask = 4 and tout comes before tcrit,
c          in which case answers at t = tout are returned first).
c
c istate = an index used for input and output to specify the
c          the state of the calculation.
c
c          on input, the values of istate are as follows.
c          1  means this is the first call for the problem
c             (initializations will be done).  see note below.
c          2  means this is not the first call, and the calculation
c             is to continue normally, with no change in any input
c             parameters except possibly tout and itask.
c             (if itol, rtol, and/or atol are changed between calls
c             with istate = 2, the new values will be used but not
c             tested for legality.)
c          3  means this is not the first call, and the
c             calculation is to continue normally, but with
c             a change in input parameters other than
c             tout and itask.  changes are allowed in
c             neq, itol, rtol, atol, iopt, lrw, liw, jt, ml, mu,
c             and any optional inputs except h0, mxordn, and mxords.
c             (see iwork description for ml and mu.)
c          note..  a preliminary call with tout = t is not counted
c          as a first call here, as no initialization or checking of
c          input is done.  (such a call is sometimes useful for the
c          purpose of outputting the initial conditions.)
c          thus the first call for which tout .ne. t requires
c          istate = 1 on input.
c
c          on output, istate has the following values and meanings.
c           1  means nothing was done, as tout was equal to t with
c              istate = 1 on input.  (however, an internal counter was
c              set to detect and prevent repeated calls of this type.)
c           2  means the integration was performed successfully.
c          -1  means an excessive amount of work (more than mxstep
c              steps) was done on this call, before completing the
c              requested task, but the integration was otherwise
c              successful as far as t.  (mxstep is an optional input
c              and is normally 500.)  to continue, the user may
c              simply reset istate to a value .gt. 1 and call again
c              (the excess work step counter will be reset to 0).
c              in addition, the user may increase mxstep to avoid
c              this error return (see below on optional inputs).
c          -2  means too much accuracy was requested for the precision
c              of the machine being used.  this was detected before
c              completing the requested task, but the integration
c              was successful as far as t.  to continue, the tolerance
c              parameters must be reset, and istate must be set
c              to 3.  the optional output tolsf may be used for this
c              purpose.  (note.. if this condition is detected before
c              taking any steps, then an illegal input return
c              (istate = -3) occurs instead.)
c          -3  means illegal input was detected, before taking any
c              integration steps.  see written message for details.
c              note..  if the solver detects an infinite loop of calls
c              to the solver with illegal input, it will cause
c              the run to stop.
c          -4  means there were repeated error test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              the problem may have a singularity, or the input
c              may be inappropriate.
c          -5  means there were repeated convergence test failures on
c              one attempted step, before completing the requested
c              task, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              this may be caused by an inaccurate jacobian matrix,
c              if one is being used.
c          -6  means ewt(i) became zero for some i during the
c              integration.  pure relative error control (atol(i)=0.0)
c              was requested on a variable which has now vanished.
c              the integration was successful as far as t.
c          -7  means the length of rwork and/or iwork was too small to
c              proceed, but the integration was successful as far as t.
c              this happens when lsoda chooses to switch methods
c              but lrw and/or liw is too small for the new method.
c
c          note..  since the normal output value of istate is 2,
c          it does not need to be reset for normal continuation.
c          also, since a negative input value of istate will be
c          regarded as illegal, a negative output value requires the
c          user to change it, and possibly other inputs, before
c          calling the solver again.
c
c iopt   = an integer flag to specify whether or not any optional
c          inputs are being used on this call.  input only.
c          the optional inputs are listed separately below.
c          iopt = 0 means no optional inputs are being used.
c                   default values will be used in all cases.
c          iopt = 1 means one or more optional inputs are being used.
c
c rwork  = a real array (double precision) for work space, and (in the
c          first 20 words) for conditional and optional inputs and
c          optional outputs.
c          as lsoda switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
c          methods, the required length of rwork can change during the
c          problem.  thus the rwork array passed to lsoda can either
c          have a static (fixed) length large enough for both methods,
c          or have a dynamic (changing) length altered by the calling
c          program in response to output from lsoda.
c
c                       --- fixed length case ---
c          if the rwork length is to be fixed, it should be at least
c               max (lrn, lrs),
c          where lrn and lrs are the rwork lengths required when the
c          current method is nonstiff or stiff, respectively.
c
c          the separate rwork length requirements lrn and lrs are
c          as follows..
c          if neq is constant and the maximum method orders have
c          their default values, then
c             lrn = 20 + 16*neq,
c             lrs = 22 + 9*neq + neq**2           if jt = 1 or 2,
c             lrs = 22 + 10*neq + (2*ml+mu)*neq   if jt = 4 or 5.
c          under any other conditions, lrn and lrs are given by..
c             lrn = 20 + nyh*(mxordn+1) + 3*neq,
c             lrs = 20 + nyh*(mxords+1) + 3*neq + lmat,
c          where
c             nyh    = the initial value of neq,
c             mxordn = 12, unless a smaller value is given as an
c                      optional input,
c             mxords = 5, unless a smaller value is given as an
c                      optional input,
c             lmat   = length of matrix work space..
c             lmat   = neq**2 + 2              if jt = 1 or 2,
c             lmat   = (2*ml + mu + 1)*neq + 2 if jt = 4 or 5.
c
c                       --- dynamic length case ---
c          if the length of rwork is to be dynamic, then it should
c          be at least lrn or lrs, as defined above, depending on the
c          current method.  initially, it must be at least lrn (since
c          lsoda starts with the nonstiff method).  on any return
c          from lsoda, the optional output mcur indicates the current
c          method.  if mcur differs from the value it had on the
c          previous return, or if there has only been one call to
c          lsoda and mcur is now 2, then lsoda has switched
c          methods during the last call, and the length of rwork
c          should be reset (to lrn if mcur = 1, or to lrs if
c          mcur = 2).  (an increase in the rwork length is required
c          if lsoda returned istate = -7, but not otherwise.)
c          after resetting the length, call lsoda with istate = 3
c          to signal that change.
c
c lrw    = the length of the array rwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c iwork  = an integer array for work space.
c          as lsoda switches automatically between stiff and nonstiff
c          methods, the required length of iwork can change during
c          problem, between
c             lis = 20 + neq   and   lin = 20,
c          respectively.  thus the iwork array passed to lsoda can
c          either have a fixed length of at least 20 + neq, or have a
c          dynamic length of at least lin or lis, depending on the
c          current method.  the comments on dynamic length under
c          rwork above apply here.  initially, this length need
c          only be at least lin = 20.
c
c          the first few words of iwork are used for conditional and
c          optional inputs and optional outputs.
c
c          the following 2 words in iwork are conditional inputs..
c            iwork(1) = ml     these are the lower and upper
c            iwork(2) = mu     half-bandwidths, respectively, of the
c                       banded jacobian, excluding the main diagonal.
c                       the band is defined by the matrix locations
c                       (i,j) with i-ml .le. j .le. i+mu.  ml and mu
c                       must satisfy  0 .le.  ml,mu  .le. neq-1.
c                       these are required if jt is 4 or 5, and
c                       ignored otherwise.  ml and mu may in fact be
c                       the band parameters for a matrix to which
c                       df/dy is only approximately equal.
c
c liw    = the length of the array iwork, as declared by the user.
c          (this will be checked by the solver.)
c
c note.. the base addresses of the work arrays must not be
c altered between calls to lsoda for the same problem.
c the contents of the work arrays must not be altered
c between calls, except possibly for the conditional and
c optional inputs, and except for the last 3*neq words of rwork.
c the latter space is used for internal scratch space, and so is
c available for use by the user outside lsoda between calls, if
c desired (but not for use by f or jac).
c
c jac    = the name of the user-supplied routine to compute the
c          jacobian matrix, df/dy, if jt = 1 or 4.  the jac routine
c          is optional, but if the problem is expected to be stiff much
c          of the time, you are encouraged to supply jac, for the sake
c          of efficiency.  (alternatively, set jt = 2 or 5 to have
c          lsoda compute df/dy internally by difference quotients.)
c          if and when lsoda uses df/dy, if treats this neq by neq
c          matrix either as full (jt = 1 or 2), or as banded (jt =
c          4 or 5) with half-bandwidths ml and mu (discussed under
c          iwork above).  in either case, if jt = 1 or 4, the jac
c          routine must compute df/dy as a function of the scalar t
c          and the vector y.  it is to have the form
c               subroutine jac (neq, t, y, ml, mu, pd, nrowpd)
c               dimension y(1), pd(nrowpd,1)
c          where neq, t, y, ml, mu, and nrowpd are input and the array
c          pd is to be loaded with partial derivatives (elements of
c          the jacobian matrix) on output.  pd must be given a first
c          dimension of nrowpd.  t and y have the same meaning as in
c          subroutine f.  (in the dimension statement above, 1 is a
c          dummy dimension.. it can be replaced by any value.)
c               in the full matrix case (jt = 1), ml and mu are
c          ignored, and the jacobian is to be loaded into pd in
c          columnwise manner, with df(i)/dy(j) loaded into pd(i,j).
c               in the band matrix case (jt = 4), the elements
c          within the band are to be loaded into pd in columnwise
c          manner, with diagonal lines of df/dy loaded into the rows
c          of pd.  thus df(i)/dy(j) is to be loaded into pd(i-j+mu+1,j).
c          ml and mu are the half-bandwidth parameters (see iwork).
c          the locations in pd in the two triangular areas which
c          correspond to nonexistent matrix elements can be ignored
c          or loaded arbitrarily, as they are overwritten by lsoda.
c               jac need not provide df/dy exactly.  a crude
c          approximation (possibly with a smaller bandwidth) will do.
c               in either case, pd is preset to zero by the solver,
c          so that only the nonzero elements need be loaded by jac.
c          each call to jac is preceded by a call to f with the same
c          arguments neq, t, and y.  thus to gain some efficiency,
c          intermediate quantities shared by both calculations may be
c          saved in a user common block by f and not recomputed by jac,
c          if desired.  also, jac may alter the y array, if desired.
c          jac must be declared external in the calling program.
c               subroutine jac may access user-defined quantities in
c          neq(2),... and/or in y(neq(1)+1),... if neq is an array
c          (dimensioned in jac) and/or y has length exceeding neq(1).
c          see the descriptions of neq and y above.
c
c jt     = jacobian type indicator.  used only for input.
c          jt specifies how the jacobian matrix df/dy will be
c          treated, if and when lsoda requires this matrix.
c          jt has the following values and meanings..
c           1 means a user-supplied full (neq by neq) jacobian.
c           2 means an internally generated (difference quotient) full
c             jacobian (using neq extra calls to f per df/dy value).
c           4 means a user-supplied banded jacobian.
c           5 means an internally generated banded jacobian (using
c             ml+mu+1 extra calls to f per df/dy evaluation).
c          if jt = 1 or 4, the user must supply a subroutine jac
c          (the name is arbitrary) as described above under jac.
c          if jt = 2 or 5, a dummy argument can be used.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional inputs.
c
c the following is a list of the optional inputs provided for in the
c call sequence.  (see also part ii.)  for each such input variable,
c this table lists its name as used in this documentation, its
c location in the call sequence, its meaning, and the default value.
c the use of any of these inputs requires iopt = 1, and in that
c case all of these inputs are examined.  a value of zero for any
c of these optional inputs will cause the default value to be used.
c thus to use a subset of the optional inputs, simply preload
c locations 5 to 10 in rwork and iwork to 0.0 and 0 respectively, and
c then set those of interest to nonzero values.
c
c name    location      meaning and default value
c
c h0      rwork(5)  the step size to be attempted on the first step.
c                   the default value is determined by the solver.
c
c hmax    rwork(6)  the maximum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is infinite.
c
c hmin    rwork(7)  the minimum absolute step size allowed.
c                   the default value is 0.  (this lower bound is not
c                   enforced on the final step before reaching tcrit
c                   when itask = 4 or 5.)
c
c ixpr    iwork(5)  flag to generate extra printing at method switches.
c                   ixpr = 0 means no extra printing (the default).
c                   ixpr = 1 means print data on each switch.
c                   t, h, and nst will be printed on the same logical
c                   unit as used for error messages.
c
c mxstep  iwork(6)  maximum number of (internally defined) steps
c                   allowed during one call to the solver.
c                   the default value is 500.
c
c mxhnil  iwork(7)  maximum number of messages printed (per problem)
c                   warning that t + h = t on a step (h = step size).
c                   this must be positive to result in a non-default
c                   value.  the default value is 10.
c
c mxordn  iwork(8)  the maximum order to be allowed for the nonstiff
c                   (adams) method.  the default value is 12.
c                   if mxordn exceeds the default value, it will
c                   be reduced to the default value.
c                   mxordn is held constant during the problem.
c
c mxords  iwork(9)  the maximum order to be allowed for the stiff
c                   (bdf) method.  the default value is 5.
c                   if mxords exceeds the default value, it will
c                   be reduced to the default value.
c                   mxords is held constant during the problem.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c optional outputs.
c
c as optional additional output from lsoda, the variables listed
c below are quantities related to the performance of lsoda
c which are available to the user.  these are communicated by way of
c the work arrays, but also have internal mnemonic names as shown.
c except where stated otherwise, all of these outputs are defined
c on any successful return from lsoda, and on any return with
c istate = -1, -2, -4, -5, or -6.  on an illegal input return
c (istate = -3), they will be unchanged from their existing values
c (if any), except possibly for tolsf, lenrw, and leniw.
c on any error return, outputs relevant to the error will be defined,
c as noted below.
c
c name    location      meaning
c
c hu      rwork(11) the step size in t last used (successfully).
c
c hcur    rwork(12) the step size to be attempted on the next step.
c
c tcur    rwork(13) the current value of the independent variable
c                   which the solver has actually reached, i.e. the
c                   current internal mesh point in t.  on output, tcur
c                   will always be at least as far as the argument
c                   t, but may be farther (if interpolation was done).
c
c tolsf   rwork(14) a tolerance scale factor, greater than 1.0,
c                   computed when a request for too much accuracy was
c                   detected (istate = -3 if detected at the start of
c                   the problem, istate = -2 otherwise).  if itol is
c                   left unaltered but rtol and atol are uniformly

c                   (the user may also ignore tolsf and alter the

c
c imxer   iwork(16) the index of the component of largest magnitude in
c                   the weighted local error vector ( e(i)/ewt(i) ),

c

c                   that the length of rwork is to be fixed for the
c                   rest of the problem, and that switching may occur.
c                   this is defined on normal returns and on an illegal

c
c the following two arrays are segments of the rwork array which
c may also be of interest to the user as optional outputs.
c for each array, the table below gives its internal name,

c name    base address      description
c
c yh      21             the nordsieck history array, of size nyh by
c                        (nqcur + 1), where nyh is the initial value
c                        of neq.  for j = 0,1,...,nqcur, column j+1

c
c acor     lacor         array of size neq used for the accumulated
c         (from common   corrections on each step, scaled on output
c           as noted)    to represent the estimated local error in y
c                        on the last step.  this is the vector e in

c                        the base address lacor is obtained by

c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part ii.  other routines callable.
c
c the following are optional calls which the user may make to
c gain additional capabilities in conjunction with lsoda.
c (the routines xsetun and xsetf are designed to conform to the
c slatec error handling package.)
c
c     form of call                  function
c   call xsetun(lun)          set the logical unit number, lun, for
c                             output of messages from lsoda, if
c                             the default is not desired.
c                             the default value of lun is 6.
c
c   call xsetf(mflag)         set a flag to control the printing of
c                             messages by lsoda.
c                             mflag = 0 means do not print. (danger..
c                             this risks losing valuable information.)
c                             mflag = 1 means print (the default).
c
c                             either of the above calls may be made at
c                             any time and will take effect immediately.
c
c   call srcma(rsav,isav,job) saves and restores the contents of
c                             the internal common blocks used by
c                             lsoda (see part iii below).
c                             rsav must be a real array of length 240
c                             or more, and isav must be an integer
c                             array of length 50 or more.
c                             job=1 means save common into rsav/isav.
c                             job=2 means restore common from rsav/isav.
c                                srcma is useful if one is
c                             interrupting a run and restarting
c                             later, or alternating between two or
c                             more problems solved with lsoda.
c
c   call intdy(,,,,,)         provide derivatives of y, of various
c        (see below)          orders, at a specified point t, if
c                             desired.  it may be called only after
c                             a successful return from lsoda.
c
c the detailed instructions for using intdy are as follows.
c the form of the call is..
c
c   call intdy (t, k, rwork(21), nyh, dky, iflag)
c
c the input parameters are..
c
c t         = value of independent variable where answers are desired
c             (normally the same as the t last returned by lsoda).
c             for valid results, t must lie between tcur - hu and tcur.
c             (see optional outputs for tcur and hu.)
c k         = integer order of the derivative desired.  k must satisfy
c             0 .le. k .le. nqcur, where nqcur is the current order
c             (see optional outputs).  the capability corresponding
c             to k = 0, i.e. computing y(t), is already provided
c             by lsoda directly.  since nqcur .ge. 1, the first
c             derivative dy/dt is always available with intdy.
c rwork(21) = the base address of the history array yh.
c nyh       = column length of yh, equal to the initial value of neq.
c
c the output parameters are..
c
c dky       = a real array of length neq containing the computed value
c             of the k-th derivative of y(t).
c iflag     = integer flag, returned as 0 if k and t were legal,
c             -1 if k was illegal, and -2 if t was illegal.
c             on an error return, a message is also written.
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iii.  common blocks.
c
c if lsoda is to be used in an overlay situation, the user
c must declare, in the primary overlay, the variables in..
c   (1) the call sequence to lsoda,
c   (2) the three internal common blocks
c         /ls0001/  of length  257  (218 double precision words
c                         followed by 39 integer words),
c         /lsa001/  of length  31    (22 double precision words
c                         followed by  9 integer words),
c         /eh0001/  of length  2 (integer words).
c
c if lsoda is used on a system in which the contents of internal
c common blocks are not preserved between calls, the user should
c declare the above common blocks in his main program to insure
c that their contents are preserved.
c
c if the solution of a given problem by lsoda is to be interrupted
c and then later continued, such as when restarting an interrupted run
c or alternating between two or more problems, the user should save,
c following the return from the last lsoda call prior to the
c interruption, the contents of the call sequence variables and the
c internal common blocks, and later restore these values before the
c next lsoda call for that problem.  to save and restore the common
c blocks, use subroutine srcma (see part ii above).
c
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c part iv.  optionally replaceable solver routines.
c
c below is a description of a routine in the lsoda package which
c relates to the measurement of errors, and can be
c replaced by a user-supplied version, if desired.  however, since such
c a replacement may have a major impact on performance, it should be
c done only when absolutely necessary, and only with great caution.
c (note.. the means by which the package version of a routine is
c superseded by the user-s version may be system-dependent.)
c
c (a) ewset.
c the following subroutine is called just before each internal
c integration step, and sets the array of error weights, ewt, as
c described under itol/rtol/atol above..
c     subroutine ewset (neq, itol, rtol, atol, ycur, ewt)
c where neq, itol, rtol, and atol are as in the lsoda call sequence,
c ycur contains the current dependent variable vector, and
c ewt is the array of weights set by ewset.
c
c if the user supplies this subroutine, it must return in ewt(i)
c (i = 1,...,neq) a positive quantity suitable for comparing errors
c in y(i) to.  the ewt array returned by ewset is passed to the
c vmnorm routine, and also used by lsoda in the computation
c of the optional output imxer, and the increments for difference
c quotient jacobians.
c
c in the user-supplied version of ewset, it may be desirable to use
c the current values of derivatives of y.  derivatives up to order nq
c are available from the history array yh, described above under
c optional outputs.  in ewset, yh is identical to the ycur array,
c extended to nq + 1 columns with a column length of nyh and scale
c factors of h**j/factorial(j).  on the first call for the problem,
c given by nst = 0, nq is 1 and h is temporarily set to 1.0.
c the quantities nq, nyh, h, and nst can be obtained by including
c in ewset the statements..
c     double precision h, rls
c     common /ls0001/ rls(218),ils(39)
c     nq = ils(35)
c     nyh = ils(14)
c     nst = ils(36)
c     h = rls(212)
c thus, for example, the current value of dy/dt can be obtained as
c ycur(nyh+i)/h  (i=1,...,neq)  (and the division by h is
c unnecessary when nst = 0).
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c other routines in the lsoda package.
c
c in addition to subroutine lsoda, the lsoda package includes the
c following subroutines and function routines..
c  intdy    computes an interpolated value of the y vector at t = tout.
c  stoda    is the core integrator, which does one step of the
c           integration and the associated error control.
c  cfode    sets all method coefficients and test constants.
c  prja     computes and preprocesses the jacobian matrix j = df/dy
c           and the newton iteration matrix p = i - h*l0*j.
c  solsy    manages solution of linear system in chord iteration.
c  ewset    sets the error weight vector ewt before each step.
c  vmnorm   computes the weighted max-norm of a vector.
c  fnorm    computes the norm of a full matrix consistent with the
c           weighted max-norm on vectors.
c  bnorm    computes the norm of a band matrix consistent with the
c           weighted max-norm on vectors.
c  srcma    is a user-callable routine to save and restore
c           the contents of the internal common blocks.
c  dgefa and dgesl   are routines from linpack for solving full
c           systems of linear algebraic equations.
c  dgbfa and dgbsl   are routines from linpack for solving banded
c           linear systems.
c  daxpy, dscal, idamax, and ddot   are basic linear algebra modules
c           (blas) used by the above linpack routines.
c  d1mach   computes the unit roundoff in a machine-independent manner.
c  xerrwv, xsetun, and xsetf   handle the printing of all error
c           messages and warnings.  xerrwv is machine-dependent.
c note..  vmnorm, fnorm, bnorm, idamax, ddot, and d1mach are function
c routines.  all the others are subroutines.
c
c the intrinsic and external routines used by lsoda are..
c dabs, dmax1, dmin1, dfloat, max0, min0, mod, dsign, dsqrt, and write.
c
c a block data subprogram is also included with the package,
c for loading some of the variables in internal common.

c intdy computes interpolated values of the k-th derivative of the
c dependent variable vector y, and stores it in dky.  this routine
c is called within the package with k = 0 and t = tout, but may
c also be called by the user for any k up to the current order.
c (see detailed instructions in the usage documentation.)
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c the computed values in dky are gotten by interpolation using the
c nordsieck history array yh.  this array corresponds uniquely to a
c vector-valued polynomial of degree nqcur or less, and dky is set
c to the k-th derivative of this polynomial at t.
c the formula for dky is..
c              q
c  dky(i)  =  sum  c(j,k) * (t - tn)**(j-k) * h**(-j) * yh(i,j+1)

c prja is called by stoda to compute and process the matrix
c p = i - h*el(1)*j , where j is an approximation to the jacobian.
c here j is computed by the user-supplied routine jac if
c miter = 1 or 4 or by finite differencing if miter = 2 or 5.
c j, scaled by -h*el(1), is stored in wm.  then the norm of j (the
c matrix norm consistent with the weighted max-norm on vectors given
c by vmnorm) is computed, and j is overwritten by p.  p is then
c subjected to lu decomposition in preparation for later solution
c of linear systems with p as coefficient matrix. this is done
c by dgefa if miter = 1 or 2, and by dgbfa if miter = 4 or 5.

c         lu decomposition of p.

c         wm(1) = sqrt(uround), used in numerical jacobian increments.
c iwm   = integer work space containing pivot information, starting at
c         iwm(21).   iwm also contains the band parameters
c         ml = iwm(1) and mu = iwm(2) if miter is 4 or 5.
c el0   = el(1) (input).
c pdnorm= norm of jacobian matrix. (output).

c         p matrix found to be singular.

c note.. stoda is independent of the value of the iteration method
c indicator miter, when this is .ne. 0, and hence is independent
c of the type of chord method used, or the jacobian structure.
c communication with stoda is done with the following variables..
c
c y      = an array of length .ge. n used as the y argument in
c          all calls to f and jac.
c neq    = integer array containing problem size in neq(1), and
c          passed as the neq argument in all calls to f and jac.

c          and their approximate scaled derivatives, where
c          lmax = maxord + 1.  yh(i,j+1) contains the approximate
c          j-th derivative of y(i), scaled by h**j/factorial(j)
c          (j = 0,1,...,nq).  on entry for the first step, the first
c          two columns of yh must be set from the initial values.
c nyh    = a constant integer .ge. n, the first dimension of yh.
c yh1    = a one-dimensional array occupying the same space as yh.
c ewt    = an array of length n containing multiplicative weights
c          for local error measurements.  local errors in y(i) are
c          compared to 1.0/ewt(i) in various error tests.
c savf   = an array of working storage, of length n.
c acor   = a work array of length n, used for the accumulated
c          corrections.  on a successful return, acor(i) contains
c          the estimated one-step local error in y(i).
c wm,iwm = real and integer work arrays associated with matrix

c slvs   = name of routine to solve linear system in chord iteration.
c ccmax  = maximum relative change in h*el0 before pjac is called.

c          on return, jstart is set to 1 to facilitate continuation.
c kflag  = a completion code with the following meanings..

c              -2  corrector convergence could not be achieved.
c              -3  fatal error in pjac or slvs.
c          a return with kflag = -1 or -2 means either
c          abs(h) = hmin or 10 consecutive failures occurred.
c          on a return with kflag negative, the values of tn and
c          the yh array are as of the beginning of the last
c          step, and h is the last step size attempted.

c miter  = corrector iteration method.
c          miter = 0 means functional iteration.
c          miter = jt .gt. 0 means a chord iteration corresponding
c          to jacobian type jt.  (the lsoda argument jt is
c          communicated here as jtyp, but is not used in stoda

c subroutines xerrwv, xsetf, and xsetun, as given here, constitute
c a simplified version of the slatec error handling package.
c written by a. c. hindmarsh at llnl.  version of march 30, 1987.
c this version is in double precision.
c
c all arguments are input arguments.
c
c msg    = the message (hollerith literal or integer array).
c nmes   = the length of msg (number of characters).
c nerr   = the error number (not used).
c level  = the error level..
c          0 or 1 means recoverable (control returns to caller).
c          2 means fatal (run is aborted--see note below).
c ni     = number of integers (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
c i1,i2  = integers to be printed, depending on ni.
c nr     = number of reals (0, 1, or 2) to be printed with message.
c r1,r2  = reals to be printed, depending on nr.
c
c note..  this routine is machine-dependent and specialized for use
c in limited context, in the following ways..
c 1. the number of hollerith characters stored per word, denoted
c    by ncpw below, is a data-loaded constant.
c 2. the value of nmes is assumed to be at most 60.
c    (multi-line messages are generated by repeated calls.)
c 3. if level = 2, control passes to the statement   stop
c    to abort the run.  this statement may be machine-dependent.
c 4. r1 and r2 are assumed to be in double precision and are printed
c    in d21.13 format.
c 5. the common block /eh0001/ below is data-loaded (a machine-
c    dependent feature) with default values.
c    this block is needed for proper retention of parameters used by
c    this routine which the user can reset by calling xsetf or xsetun.
c    the variables in this block are as follows..
c       mesflg = print control flag..
c                1 means print all messages (the default).
c                0 means no printing.
c       lunit  = logical unit number for messages.
c                the default is 6 (machine-dependent).
c-----------------------------------------------------------------------
c the following are instructions for installing this routine
c in different machine environments.
c
c to change the default output unit, change the data statement
c in the block data subprogram below.
c
c for a different number of characters per word, change the
c data statement setting ncpw below, and format 10.  alternatives for
c various computers are shown in comment cards.
c
c for a different run-abort command, change the statement following
c statement 100 at the end.
