Quadrature Rules for a Cube in 3D {#cube_felippa_rule-quadrature-rules-for-a-cube-in-3d align="center"}
=================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**CUBE\_FELIPPA\_RULE** is a C++ library which generates the points and
weights of a Felippa quadrature rule over the interior of a cube in 3D.

Actually, the word "cube" is meant to designate any quadrature region
defined by:

            A(1) <= X <= B(1)
            A(2) <= Y <= B(2)
            A(3) <= Z <= B(3)
