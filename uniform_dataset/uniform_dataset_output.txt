UNIFORM_DATASET (C++ version)
  Generate a uniform pseudorandom dataset.

  This program is meant to be used interactively.
  It is also possible to prepare a simple input
  file beforehand and use it in batch mode.

  The program requests input values from the user:

  * M, the spatial dimension,
  * N, the number of points to generate,
  * SEED, a positive integer.

  The program generates the data, writes it to the file

    uniform_M_N.txt

  where M and N are the numeric values specified
  by the user, and then asks the user for more input.

  To indicate that no further computations are
  desired, it is enough to input a nonsensical value,
  such as -1.

  Enter M, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you don't have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).

  Enter N, the number of points to generate:
  (Try '25' if you don't have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).

  Enter SEED, which is 0 or a positive integer.
  ('0' will cause the program to pick a value for you.)
  (Try '0' or '123456789' if you don't have a preference.)
  (Any negative value terminates execution).

  The data was written to the file "uniform_2_100.txt".

  Enter M, the spatial dimension:
  (Try '2' if you don't have a preference.)
  (0 or any negative value terminates execution).

UNIFORM_DATASET
  The input value of M = -1
  is interpreted as a request for termination.
  Normal end of execution.
