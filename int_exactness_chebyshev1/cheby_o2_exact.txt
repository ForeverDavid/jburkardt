INT_EXACTNESS_CHEBYSHEV1
  C++ version

  Investigate the polynomial exactness of a Gauss-Chebyshev
  type 1 quadrature rule by integrating weighted
  monomials up to a given degree over the [-1,+1] interval.

INT_EXACTNESS_CHEBYSHEV1: User input:
  Quadrature rule X file = "cheby_o2_x.txt".
  Quadrature rule W file = "cheby_o2_w.txt".
  Quadrature rule R file = "cheby_o2_r.txt".
  Maximum degree to check = 5
