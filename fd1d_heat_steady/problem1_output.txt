PROBLEM1:
  C++ version
  A test problem for FD1D_HEAT_STEADY.

FD1D_HEAT_STEADY
  C++ version

  Finite difference solution of
  the steady 1D heat equation

    - d/dx ( k(x) dUdx ) = F(x)

  for space interval A <= X <= B with boundary conditions

    U(A) = UA
    U(B) = UB

  A second order difference approximation is used.

  X data written to "problem1_x.txt".
  U data written to "problem1_u.txt".

PROBLEM1:
  Normal end of execution.
